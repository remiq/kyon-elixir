# kyon-elixir

Catabooru / remiq.net / kyon.pl reborn.


Goal of this project is NOT to innovate - for this reason it will not use Elixir-specific features
like OTP (directly, Phoenix uses OTP). Just simple use of Phoenix framework to recreate 80% of functionality.

Sub-goals:
* we should use the same database and file formats to allow reimport of old data
* open-source it
